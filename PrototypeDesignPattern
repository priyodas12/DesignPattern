Prototype Design Pattern:

Whenever we are creating costly object that means to create this object we have to
we external resource or may be an internal big calculation procedure to create this objcet
for that we will use the existing instance as a prototype to make copy.

in java we can implement this by objecct class clone method.

1.class must implement Clonable(I) marker interface.
2.class must override clone()
3.class must support CloneNotSupportedException in to avoid exceptional use case.
