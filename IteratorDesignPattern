comes under Behavioral design pattern

Iterator allows a way to access elements/children of an aggregate object in a sequence while hiding actual internal data structure.

aggregate object->any child class object of collection.

In java Iterator(I) are integral part of collection framework and they are implementations of this design pattern.

Iterators are stateful,meaning an iterator object remembers its position while iterator.
